# Data-Wrangling

Exploring and understanding the data is one of the most important parts of the data wrangling process. It is required to perform graphical and/or non-graphical EDA methods to understand
the data first and then find and fix the data problems. 
You are required to:

● Detect and fix errors in dirty_data.csv file.

● Detect and remove outlier rows in outlier_data.csv file.

● Impute the missing values in missing_data.csv file.
